title: Starting Over
---
I've tried blogging at various times over the years. My most recent run was from 2013-2017 in which I averaged about one post a year. Suffice it to say, I wasn't into it.

I'm trying to get back into it. Recently I've renewed my focus on the Internet outside of the big social networks; the network as it used to be, back when I first cut my teeth in the 1990s and 2000s. As part of that, I'm making a 2021 goal of writing more, or at least more often. And it starts here, now.

Thanks for reading!
