Answers to [Christina's Five Questions](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/users/christina/) (in native Gemini format [here](gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/christina/)):

_This year, did you try reading a book in a genre you usually don't gravitate to? What did you think of it?_

Not yet. I honestly don't read much for pleasure. (Shock! Horror!) But I'll probably get to this eventually.

_Have you ever made a New Year's resolution that you stuck to? (Are you still sticking to it?)_

I resolved to lose weight this year, and I was down about 19 pounds at last weigh-in, due to diet changes and an adjustment to my blood sugar medication. I'm pretty psyched about this but also realize there's more that I can do. So yes, I'm sticking to it.

_What does "healthy" mean to you?_

Good question. For a long time I have been reasonably well and un-sick, while also having a few chronic conditions under control (see previous answer.) By those terms, I could be considered "healthy" and I did so consider myself. But recent deaths and unwellness in the family have made me reconsider this and try to take a more active approach towards eliminating chronic conditions or at least having them reduced to less concerning levels (such as my weight - again, see previous answer.) So maybe I consider myself less "healthy" overall, although certainly not in imminent danger of death. tl;dr I dunno?

_Are you an early bird or a night owl?_

Definitely a night owl.

_Will you get the COVID vaccine? Why or why not?_

Yes. I am at high risk due to having ruptured and subsequently lost my spleen when hit by an out-of-control driver on the Beltway many years ago, as well as other underlying conditions. I trust in science and medicine, and believe it is the right thing to do for me and those who depend on me. That said, I was already a crowd-avoider before the pandemic, and continue thus, so if I have to wait my turn for the vaccine (and it appears, based on current DC Health guidelines, that I will) it is not a big deal to me.
