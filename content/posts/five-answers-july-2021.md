I am going to try to answer [Christina's Five Questions](gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/christina/) more often. In keeping with the spirit in which Ms. O'Twisty presents the questions, my answers are available in [Gemini format](gemini://tilde.team/~mcornick/).

_Five items you are most likely to buy at a convenience store?_

Diet cola; coffee; snack foods; antacids; some fifth thing that would further justify the fourth thing. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, and drink alcohol very sparingly, so junk food is my main vice and heartburn is my penance for said vice.

_Tell me about the last book you read._

Dull documentation for work. Oh, you mean for fun? _A Dance With Dragons_, the fifth in the _Song Of Ice And Fire_ series by George R. R. Martin, known far and wide as the basis for the _Game of Thrones_ TV series. I resolved to read the books before watching the corresponding TV episodes. This worked well until the TV diverged radically from the books. Anyway, I enjoyed both. I still don't read much for fun, though.

_Do you have a favourite postage stamp?_

A few years ago the USPS and Canada Post jointly issued a series of stamps featuring the history of hockey. Those were pretty cool.

_What is your current favourite hobby?_

DJing on tilderadio and anonradio. Takes me back to when I was a DJ on a "real" FM radio station in college. Our station was only 390 watts of power due to being in a "quiet zone" established for the benefit of radioastronomy and spying - barely enough to reach the entire town we were in. But, as Kick-Ass said, with no power comes no responsibility, and we had a lot of fun.

_Who was the most famous person you shook hands with?_

I got to meet Dave Matthews when his band came to play a benefit concert put on by said college radio station, before they became big international pop stars. He and his band got their start in Charlottesville, where I'm from. Nice guy, very good to the community, but I can't stand his music. /shrug
