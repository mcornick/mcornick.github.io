I did my first episode of the Moose Hour tonight. This was the first time I've done a radio show, live or otherwise, since I graduated from university way back in 1996. Yep, 25 years. That's a long time.

And, aside from a few minor technical glitches (which are to be expected, after all) it went great! It felt like old times, just playing music and talking about it. I'm looking forward to doing it again.

I'm going to be accumulating playlists in a section of this site. It's linked from the home page and the first playlist from tonight's show is already up.

I'm grateful to the folks at [tilderadio](https://tilderadio.org/) for giving me a time slot and to my fellow DJs and other listeners who tuned in. I very much appreciate the community-oriented, people-over-profit approach of the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/) and urge other people who remember the way the Internet "used to be" to check it out.
